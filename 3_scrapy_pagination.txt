There can be n number of logical solutions to handle the pagination and it's always unique one each time.
So, it depends what your use case is and how you want to handle it.

1: One way is to check if the 'link' to the next page is available, if yes follow it and make callback to same function
    For e.g:
        next_page = response.xpath("//a[@class='nextPage']/@href").get()
        if next_page:
            yield response.follow(url=next_page, callback=self.parse)

            or 

            #yield scrapy.Request(url=next_page, callback=self.parse)
